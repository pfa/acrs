#summary General information on ACRS

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Introduction =

Typically, route summarization is handled either manually or classfully. This library handles route summarization classlessly, and can be used to perform automatic summarization of arbitrary/changing lists of routes. The library is also useful for optimizing network filtering in various applications (such as access lists or firewall rules) by converting arbitrarily long lists of prefixes into their most summarized form.

The source here provides two implementations of ACRS, one in C++ and one in python. These contain a generic IP address and route class, the ACRS class, and a command line based demonstration program. Included with the python source is a CGI script and an example web page for demonstrations of ACRS on web pages.

= Explained =

The algorithm ACRS uses is very simple. There are two steps: main summarization and overlap removal.

Main summarization operates on lists of routes consisting of, at least, a network address, a prefix length, and a metric. Before summarizing, ACRS sorts the list in the following manner:

    # Primary sort by metric (sort order doesn't matter)
    # Secondary by prefix length in descending order
    # Tertiary sort by network address in ascending order

Once the list is sorted, each route in the list is compared with the next route in the list. For any two routes in the list to be summarized, these conditions must be true:

  # Their metrics must match
  # Their prefix lengths must match
  # The broadcast address of the lower route, plus one, must be equal to the network address of the higher route
  # The network address of the potential summary route must be equal to the network address of the lower route

If the above conditions are met, the two routes can be summarized by discarding the higher route and decreasing the lower route's prefix length by one. Using recursion, this process will summarize all routes within the list as much as possible without using addresses NOT specified by at least one route. For example, ACRS can summarize 192.168.16.0/25 and 192.168.16.128/25 into 192.168.16.0/24, but an administrator might know that it's safe to summarize these routes all the way down to 192.168.0.0/16. Since this information is not presented to ACRS, it has no way to account for such situations.

Once main summarization is finished, overlap removal gets rid of routes that specify identical address space. For example, 10.0.0.0/8 and 10.250.24.0/24 specify overlapping address space, so the less specific prefix can be used. (If used for routing purposes, note that this can only be done when the metric of the less specific route is better than the metric of the more specific route. This is discussed in [GettingStarted#Why_use_it?], below.)

The first step is to re-sort the routes as follows:

  # Primary sort by network address in ascending order
  # Secondary sort by prefix length in ascending order
  # Tertiary sort by metric in ascending order

Once the list is sorted, each route is again compared to the next route in the list. If the following two conditions are true, the networks may be summarized:

  # The higher route's network address ANDed with the lower route's subnet mask is equal to the lower route's network address
  # The metric of the lower route must be less than or equal to the metric of the higher route

When two routes are found to overlap, the higher network is removed from the list.

This is necessary because main summarization's rules for summarizing routes will not catch overlapping address space.

One additional note, which may come up when using the demo program:

The address added to the route list is not assumed to be a network address, necessarily. The network ID is determined as though the IP address given were a host address; that is, the address is ANDed with the mask to make sure it's a valid network ID. For example, if you specify 192.168.1.5/24, or any other address in the 192.168.1.0/24 range, this is fine; the network ID of 192.168.1.0/24 is used, not the IP address specified.

= Why use it? =

For use with a routing protocol, almost any network that is large enough to _need_ summarization already has someone that thought out its design well enough to provide a good set of summary routes. If not, not having automatically summarized routes is probably the least of the network's problems.

Changing the prefix length of a set of routes may influence routing decisions in ways that may not always be desirable. It's safest when no other summarization is already being done. For example, overlap removal could cause issues in situations where a router advertises a default route that is subject to summarization (for example, from redistribution). In such a case, all other routes would be removed from the update, given equal metrics. The impact of this is dependent on the rest of the network.

I wrote this mainly as a curiosity that I might integrate into another for-fun project of mine to provide automatic route summarization: http://code.google.com/p/advrp/

However, this can also be useful as a general purpose tool whenever large numbers of IP addresses need to be collated into a list and summarization is desirable, such as for ACLs/firewall rules. The demo program included with the source can accommodate this as-is. If you have a list of specific prefixes you wish to filter for and you suspect there is some summarization that can be done, feed that list through ACRS. Any summarization that is possible, ACRS will do -- whether the list is of individual hosts, prefixes, or a mix of the two. It will not misuse a summary address that blocks extra IPs by accident -- which you may do if you haven't had coffee -- and it fits into scripts easily.

Another possible use for ACRS would be in routing protocol for networks where route summarization is possible, but manual summarization isn't feasible, like randomly dispersed sensor networks or MANETs. Clusters of nodes must be able to form into a hierarchy (which is, admittedly, the more difficult undertaking), then two clusters can advertise summary routes to each other rather than a route for each network. The downside to this is that if a single route fails from within the summary, the entire summary must be removed and usable routes/summaries recomputed. This complicates things, and would negatively affect routing to reachable subnets without additional measures. Preemptively adding the necessary less-summarized routes before removing a summary could help mitigate the impact of this.

Using ACRS sacrifices some processing power for less memory usage (smaller routing tables). The method used for summarization can be optimized to reduce processing, and only needs to be recomputed when routes change.

= Obtaining and building =

You can download the latest source either from the tarball on the Downloads tab or using subversion. Right now, there is no difference between the tarball and the subversion source, so getting the tarball is probably easiest (and it includes a precompiled binary).

== From the tar file ==

Steps:
  # Install a C++ compiler
  # Download the tarball
  # Extract the source code
  # Run make

For Debian/Ubuntu systems:

{{{
apt-get install g++
wget http://acrs.googlecode.com/files/acrs-r75.tar.gz # Replace r75 with the latest version
tar -xzf acrs-r75.tar.gz
cd acrs/c++
make
./acrs-demo
}}}

== From subversion ==

Steps:
  # Install subversion
  # Install a C++ compiler
  # Download the code from googlecode using subversion
  # Run make

For Debian/Ubuntu systems:

{{{
apt-get install subversion g++
svn checkout http://acrs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ acrs-read-only
cd acrs-read-only/c++
make
./acrs-demo
}}}

= Using the demo =

After compiling, try this with the demo:

{{{
./acrs-demo 10.0.0.0/26 10.0.0.64/26 10.0.0.128/25
10.0.0.0/24 in 0
}}}

This shows three input routes being summarized, and the summarized route being printed to standard output. Try some other routes, too. The "in 0" message following the output prefix is the metric, and can be suppressed using the -m flag. If no metric is specified on the command line for a prefix, the demo program assigns a default metric of 0. To specify your own metric, append "mNUMBER" to the prefix entered on the command line. This is optional, and can be used for some prefixes and omitted for others. For example:

{{{
./acrs-demo 10.0.0.0/26m1 10.0.0.64/26 10.0.0.128/25
10.0.0.0/26 in 1
10.0.0.64/26 in 0
10.0.0.128/25 in 0
}}}

Notice that the first route had a metric of 1 assigned to it on the command line (10.0.0.0/26m1), which prevented the routes from being summarized. See the rules in the [GettingStarted#Explained] section for more information on how differing metrics affect summarization.

You can enable logging by passing the -l flag as the first argument to the acrs-demo command. For example:

{{{
./acrs-demo -l 10.0.1.0/26 10.0.1.64/26 10.0.0.0/24 10.0.1.128/25 10.0.0.0/16 10.0.0.0/16
* Main summarization:
*   Pass 1
*     Summarized '10.0.1.0/26 in 0' and '10.0.1.64/26 in 0' into '10.0.1.0/25 in 0'
*     Summarized '10.0.1.0/25 in 0' and '10.0.1.128/25 in 0' into '10.0.1.0/24 in 0'
*   Pass 2
*     Summarized '10.0.0.0/24 in 0' and '10.0.1.0/24 in 0' into '10.0.0.0/23 in 0'
* Overlap removal:
*   Removing '10.0.0.0/16 in 0', which falls within '10.0.0.0/16 in 0'
*   Removing '10.0.0.0/23 in 0', which falls within '10.0.0.0/16 in 0'
* Finished. List was summarized.
10.0.0.0/16 in 0
}}}

The "Pass X" statements in main summarization identify how many times the list of routes was re-ran through main summarization before it was fully summarized. Only one pass of overlap removal is necessary.

For non-routing purposes (such as for access lists), lists of individual IP addresses can be summarized by ignoring the metric and giving each address a /32 mask:

{{{
./acrs-demo 1.1.1.7/32 1.1.1.6/32 1.1.1.4/32 1.1.1.5/32
1.1.1.4/30 in 0
}}}

This works because 1.1.1.4/32 and 1.1.1.5/32 are first summarized into 1.1.1.4/31, then 1.1.1.6/32 and 1.1.1.7/32 are summarized into 1.1.1.6/31, and finally 1.1.1.4/31 and 1.1.1.6/31 are summarized into 1.1.1.4/30.

These networks will not be summarized:

{{{
./acrs-demo 1.1.1.5/32 1.1.1.6/32
1.1.1.5/32 in 0
1.1.1.6/32 in 0
}}}

Why? 1.1.1.5/31 is not a network ID (1.1.1.5/31 is a host address on the network 1.1.1.4/31). In the code, this is checked by ensuring that a potential summary route's network address is equal to the lower route's network address. The potential summary route, 1.1.1.5/31, has a network address of 1.1.1.4. This is not equal to the network address of the lower route (1.1.1.5), so the routes cannot be summarized.

The following will work, however:

{{{
./acrs-demo 1.1.1.5/32 1.1.1.4/32
1.1.1.4/31 in 0
}}}

The order of routes on the command line doesn't matter; they are sorted as needed by the library.
