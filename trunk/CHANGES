General:
    1. Added license file

C++:
    1. There were a number of IP4Addr class interface changes that made sense
       to make which allowed the C++ and python code behave more consistently
       with each other:
        1.1 get* functions now return std::pair<std::string, in_addr_t>.
            The string is the result in string form, the in_addr_t is the
            result as an NBO integer. (The getPlen function still just returns
            an int.)
        1.2 All places where char *'s were used are now using std::string
        1.3 A setMask() function was added which will distinguish between
            prefix lengths and subnet masks. The old setSnmask and setPlen
            functions are still available.
        1.4 There is now only one IP4Addr constructor taking an integer-type
            argument, and the type is now a uint32_t. It will figure out
            whether the argument is intended to be a prefix length or a subnet
            mask in HBO integer form. This means you don't have to cast
            the type in your constructor to a plen_t or in_addr_t any longer.
    3. Added unit tests using the cpptest library
    4. Added makefile

Python:
    1. The IP4Addr class will throw a TypeError if setAddr is passed something
       other than an int or str
