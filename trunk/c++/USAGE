Usage

Automatic classless route summarization (ACRS) demo program

acrs.googlecode.com

The demo takes a list of prefixes in CIDR format as command line arguments.
Optionally, a metric can be added by appending "m<NUMBER>". See the wiki for
the significance of this. If a metric is not specified for a prefix, the
default metric of 0 is used for that prefix.

The prefixes/routes are summarized based on the rules explained on the
wiki (see acrs.googlecode.com).

Example input and output:

./acrs-demo 10.0.0.0/26m0 10.0.0.64/26 10.0.0.128/25m1

10.0.0.0/25 in 0
10.0.0.128/25 in 1

The "in X" message is the metric.

Flags

-h prints a help message

-l enables logging. This prints messages detailing which routes
   are summarized and when

-m prevents the metric from being printed when the route list is printed
   (does not affect the summarization process or logging messages)
